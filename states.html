    <h1>Analysis of State Websites!</h1>

    <h1>1. Kansas</h1>
    <center><img src="kansas.png"></center>
    <p>
    The state website for Kansas provides users with an easy to read site that is simple and straight<br>
    to the point. The colors chosen for the site compliment each other nicely, giving users a friendly<br>
    welcome when they first open the site. Not only that, but the website gives clear information to the<br>
    help center and quick access tools with a helpful navigation bar at the top of the screen.

    <h1>2. Alaska</h1>
    <center><img src="alaska.png"></center>
    <p>
    While Alaska's website may not surmount the aspects of Kansas's, this site incorporates a mountainous<br>
    theme that helps the user feel as if they are surrounded by the state's beauty at home on their own<br>
    computer. The tables and dropdown menus used on the site are not super clean-cut and simple, but the<br>
    website loads very quickly overall and provides users with an easy-to-use site on mobile devices.

    <h1>3. Maine</h1>
    <center><img src="maine.avif"></center>
    <p>
    Maine's state website contains a lot of useful information, but the styling doesn't follow a consistent<br>
    theme and can be distracting in that way. There isn't a super logical order of information and this fails<br>
    to really hook a user. Aside from these interruptions, Maine's state website gets the job done with giving<br>
    enough information to satisfy an online user through a good use of lists and separated, boxed information.

    <h1>4. Arkansas</h1>
    <center><img src="arkansas.jpg"></center>
    <p>
    I love the themes used in this website, but it is just too darn slow! I think the developers went a little<br>
    too overboard on styling causing the website to slow down, but everything else looks great. Well-organized<br>
    information is separated logically in different dropdown menus and links, along with a useful and well-built<br>
    search bar at the top for easy access to information that might be hard to find. Overall, the slowness of<br>
    the website puts this in the #4 spot.

    <h1>5. Maryland</h1>
    <center><img src="maryland.webp"></center>
    <p>
    Maryland's state website is not like the others in that it is a simple, one page site with not a lot of<br>
    scrolling to do on the main page. Looking at this from a computer is not very pleasing. The lack of dropdown<br>
    menus and external links makes it tough to find information quickly. If this site had the searchbar that<br>
    Arkansas's had, it would be much more functional. Although it has its flaws on a computer screen, this site<br>
    works very well for a mobile device.
