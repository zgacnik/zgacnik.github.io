    <h1>Website Opinion Articles</h1>
    <h2>Great Website 1: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patagonia.com/home/">Patagonia</a></h2>
    <p>
        Patagonia's website offers a user-friendly layout with an aesthetically pleasing theme. Their use of cards<br>
        and hooking images draws the user in and allows for fast-paced website navigation. While the Patagonia site<br>
        can be a lot to take in at first glance, a handy search bar can be found in the navigation section of the site<br>
        that can be used for efficient and effective searches. Aside from the visual side of the website, Patagonia<br>
        implements the box model that is well-known to every website developer and uses it effectively. They incorporate<br>
        HTML5 elements with complex CSS to enhance the elements throughout their website. Most websites are lacking<br>
        in any of these categories discussed above, but when it comes to website devlopment, Patagonia nailed it!
    </p>
    <h2>Great Website 2: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nps.gov/index.htm">National Parks</a></h2>
    <p>
        It goes without saying that everyone loves a good National Park. Whether it's Zion, Yellowstone, Mesa Verde<br>
        or Glacier, National Parks offer a great way for people to enjoy the outdoors. Better yet, having a well-developed<br>
        website helps people find these amazing places from their very own home! The National Parks website instills<br>
        a simple design with many different list items and buttons to allow for quick and easy access to information.<br>
        Along with their HTML5 elements, much like Patagonia's website, the National Parks website enhances their elements<br>
        with complex CSS to make their website pop. One little aspect that sets this website apart is their links to<br>
        their mobile apps included at the bottom of the page. Along with their links to their socials, this allows for<br>
        even more users to access their data and information.
    </p>
    <h2>Terrible Website: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a></h2>
    <p>
        What do you think of when you hear Yale? I can tell you what I think: I think of very smart people who produce<br>
        quality products and gifts to the world. Apparently the Yale School of Art missed out on this, and ultimately<br>
        created the worst website I have ever seen in my entire life. It goes without saying that their website uses<br>
        an awful theme, but above all the organization of the entire site allows for anything but efficient navigation.<br>
        Their are very few HTML5 elements used on this site and the CSS that goes along with it might as well be created<br>
        by a toddler. Aside from all of these negatives, I do enjoy their calendar implementation in the middle of the<br>
        page. Aside from that, their is nothing pleasing about this site.
